data-jurisdiction.org
=====================

This is the source code for data-jurisdiction.org, a community site that aims to
build up a database of data protection laws in each jurisdiction. 

It was created (initially) by Marcus Povey <http://www.marcus-povey.co.uk> inspired by
this post by Ben Werdmuller <http://werd.io/entry/5213969abed7de1978b43b2d/government-the-last-great-gatekeeper-is-ripe-for-disruption>

To extend the database, fork the code and send in a pull request.
